Working on this project was one of the first times I truly felt the impact of my work in action. Collaborating with Fundación Despacio, the local mobility secretary of Cartagena, and a third-party bicycle tracking app, we aimed to promote sustainable transportation and highlight the potential of cycling within the city. The project focused on tracking bicycle usage across Cartagena, encouraging residents to adopt cycling as a viable mode of transport.

One of the most memorable moments was seeing the results come together and presenting them during a celebratory event. We recognized the city's most dedicated cyclist—a commuter who logged an incredible 15 kilometers each way every day on their journey to work. Witnessing their dedication and sharing their story underscored the transformative potential of our initiative.

This project wasn’t just about the data or the technology—it was about empowering people, fostering community, and contributing to a more sustainable future for Cartagena. It left me inspired by the tangible impact that thoughtful collaboration and technology can have on cities and their residents.
